      <h3>Portfolio Website Using HTML/CSS</h3>
      <p>This is a personal portfolio website built using only HTML and CSS.
         It showcases my profile, skills, projects, and contact information
          in a clean, user-friendly layout. The design features responsive navigation, 
          section-based scrolling, and a visually appealing presentation 
          of content including a hero section, skills grid, and project highlights.
           It's ideal for demonstrating front-end development basics 
           and personal branding</p>

      <h3>Personal Finance Tracker</h3>
      <p>I developed a Personal Finance Tracker using Python
         to help users manage their daily income and expenses more 
         efficiently. The main goal of this project 
         was to create a simple yet effective tool that 
         allows users to track, categorize, and view their financial transactions. 
         I used Pythonâ€™s file handling and basic data structures like dictionaries and lists to store and 
         organize the data. The program allows users to add income, 
         record expenses, view summaries by category (like food, transport, bills), and check their 
         current balance.</p>
